About
Hello, I am Harrison. 

Experience
I had initially learned python when I was 13, learning basic syntax and programming concepts. Later, I learned Java, which would come to be my most understood and best language
Learned Data Structures / Algorithms
Learned Object-Oriented Programming
and created several projects:



Since then, I've learned several other programming languages that I frequently use and practice with. Here is a list of all languages I've learned and used:



Education
I attend Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I am a third-year student with a standing GPA of 4.00/4.00, and I expect to graduate in May of 2024. I hope to apply for the Bachelors/Masters dual program soon, which would allow me to graduate with a Master of Science in Computer Science in May of 2025.

You can find my resume here, my academic history here, and my major requirements here.
